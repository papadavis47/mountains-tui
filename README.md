## A Training Log for getting good at vert

This is a training log to help me get lighter and improve my ability to run uphill and through trails for many miles.

This process can help with food awareness - thereby helping me to lose weight and not carry so much with me on my runs.

This app, as currently implemented, requires a Turso Cloud account and database. This will sync with the `libsql` db created in the user's home directory: `~/.mountains/`

The simplest way to install currently is to clone the repo, use the example `.env.example` to make your own `.env` file and build the application locally with: `cargo install --path .`

I plan on updating the app as I go along and learn more about it.

Right now, I am simply using it for my own training.
