- **Startup screen** - ASCII art logo with elevation statistics (monthly 1000+ days, yearly total, active streaks)
- **Daily food logging** with date navigation
- **Body measurements** - weight and waist size tracking
- **Activity tracking** - miles covered (walking/hiking/running) and elevation gain with yearly and monthly miles totals
- **Sokay tracking** - accountability for unhealthy food choices with cumulative counting
- **Strength & mobility tracking** - multi-line text field for logging exercises
- **Daily notes** for observations and reflections
- **Full CRUD operations** - add, edit, and delete entries for food and sokay items, plus delete entire days
- **Cursor-enabled text input** with arrow key navigation
- **Dual persistence** - Turso Cloud database (primary) with markdown file backups
- **Cloud sync** - syncs on startup and shutdown with visual progress indicator
- **Clean, responsive interface** with keyboard shortcuts

## Technology Stack

- **Rust** - Systems programming language
- **ratatui** - Terminal UI framework ([docs](https://docs.rs/ratatui/latest/ratatui/index.html))
- **crossterm** - Cross-platform terminal manipulation
- **chrono** - Date/time handling
- **serde** - Serialization for data persistence
- **libsql** - Embedded database with Turso Cloud sync
- **tokio** - Async runtime for database operations

## Key Controls

### Startup Screen

The startup screen appears every time the application launches. It displays:

- **ASCII art logo** - "MOUNTAINS" in large text art (centered)
- **Subtitle** - "For Inspiration and Mindfulness"
- **Monthly 1000+ days** - Count of days in current month with ≥1000 feet elevation
- **Yearly total** - Total feet of elevation gain for the current calendar year
- **Streak tracker** - Current consecutive days with ≥1000 feet elevation (minimum 2 days)

#### Startup Screen Controls:

- `N` - Go to Today's Log (creates if doesn't exist and opens DailyView)
- `L` - Go to Log List (opens Home screen with all daily logs)
- `q` - Quit application (syncs with Turso Cloud if online)

### Home Screen

The home screen starts with the list **unfocused** (no item highlighted).

#### When list is unfocused:

- `Enter` - Go to today's log (creating if needed)
- `j` or `↓` - Focus list and select first item (most recent date)
- `k` or `↑` - Focus list and select last item (oldest date)

#### When list is focused:

- `↑/↓` or `j/k` - Navigate between dates
- `Enter` - Go to selected date's log
- `Esc` - Unfocus the list (remove highlight)
- `D` - Delete selected day (with confirmation)

#### Always available:

- `S` - Go to Startup Screen
- `q` - Quit application (syncs with Turso Cloud if online)

### Daily View

The daily view shows all sections for tracking your training day: **Measurements**, **Running**, **Food Items**, **Sokay**, **Strength & Mobility**, and **Notes**.

#### Section Navigation

- `Shift+J` - Move focus to next section (down)
- `Shift+K` - Move focus to previous section (up)
- **Navigation order:** Measurements → Running → Food Items → Sokay → Strength & Mobility → Notes → (wraps to Measurements)
- The focused section has a **bright colored border** (yellow, red, cyan, magenta, or green depending on section)
- Unfocused sections have **dimmed gray borders**

#### Field Navigation (Measurements & Running sections only)

- `Tab` - Toggle between fields within a section
  - **Measurements:** Weight ↔ Waist
  - **Running:** Miles ↔ Elevation
- The focused field is indicated with a **► symbol**

#### List Navigation (Food Items & Sokay sections only)

Lists start **unfocused** (no item highlighted) for quick access to adding new entries.

**When list is unfocused:**

- `j/↓` - Focus first item in the list
- `k/↑` - Focus last item in the list
- `Enter` - Add new entry (same as when focused)
- `E` and `D` - Do nothing (no item to edit/delete)
- `Esc` - Return to home screen

**When list is focused (item highlighted):**

- `↑/↓` or `j/k` - Navigate between items
- `E` - Edit selected item
- `D` - Delete selected item (with confirmation)
- `Esc` - Unfocus the item (remove highlight), next Esc returns to home

#### Expanded View (Strength & Mobility and Notes sections only)

When you navigate to the **Strength & Mobility** or **Notes** section, the section automatically expands if needed to show the full text content.

**Expansion behavior:**

- Expands **vertically upward** (bottom border stays fixed, top border moves up)
- **Overlays** sections above it (no other sections move or resize)
- Only expands if content doesn't fit in the default 4-line height
- Maximum expansion: **60% of screen height**
- If content exceeds 60%, the section becomes **scrollable**

**Scrolling:**

- `↑/k` - Scroll up (when section is expanded and has more content)
- `↓/j` - Scroll down (when section is expanded and has more content)
- Scroll position **resets to top** when navigating away with Shift+J/K
- Press `Enter` to edit (same as before)

**Use case:** Easily browse longer training notes and exercise logs without squinting at the small default section. Navigate to the section with Shift+J/K, read the full content, then press Enter if you want to edit.

#### Editing Data

- `Enter` - Edit the focused section/field or add new entry (for Food/Sokay)
  - **Measurements/Running:** Opens input for the focused field
  - **Food Items:** Opens "Add Food" dialog
  - **Sokay:** Opens "Add Sokay" dialog
  - **Strength & Mobility/Notes:** Opens editor for that section

#### Shortcuts Overlay

- `Space` - Toggle shortcuts help overlay (shows all quick access shortcuts)
  - Press Space again to close the overlay
  - Displays data entry shortcuts grouped by category (Measurements, Activity, Nutrition, Training)
  - Only works when not typing in an input field

- ✅ **Complete deletion** - removes from database, app state, and markdown backups
- ✅ **Cloud sync** - deletions are synced to Turso Cloud
- ✅ **Uppercase Y required** - safety measure to prevent accidental deletions
- ✅ **Confirmation message** - displays all data that will be deleted

### Previous Session (Critical Bug Fixes)

- ✅ **Fixed async runtime deadlock** - converted all database operations to proper async/await instead of `block_on()`
- ✅ **Fixed terminal freeze on save** - eliminated panic when saving entries by removing nested async runtime calls
- ✅ **Fixed UI message interference** - removed `eprintln!` messages that stayed on screen after TUI initialization
- ✅ **Made event loop fully async** - `run()` method and all handlers are now properly async
- ✅ **Improved app stability** - terminal now properly cleans up on exit instead of freezing
- ✅ **Zero compiler warnings** - application compiles cleanly with no warnings

### Previous Session (Code Cleanup)

- ✅ **Removed unused code** - cleaned up dead code that was never executed
- ✅ **Database methods** - removed `DbManager::load_daily_log` (app loads all logs at startup)
- ✅ **File loading methods** - removed markdown parsing functions (app is database-first now)
- ✅ **AppScreen::AddMeasurements** - removed unused enum variant
- ✅ **AppState::selected_index** - removed field (replaced by ratatui's ListState)
- ✅ **UI helper function** - removed unused `create_daily_view_layout`
- ✅ **Zero warnings** - application now compiles with no warnings

### Previous Session (Strength & Mobility Tracking)

- ✅ **Strength & mobility field** - multi-line text input for logging exercises
- ✅ **`t` keyboard shortcut** - quick access to edit strength & mobility
- ✅ **Cyan-colored display** - positioned between food log and notes
- ✅ **Multi-line editing** - same as notes with arrow key navigation
- ✅ **Database persistence** - strength_mobility column with automatic migration
- ✅ **Markdown export** - "## Strength & Mobility" section in backup files
- ✅ **Cloud sync support** - integrated with Turso Cloud sync

### Previous Session (Training Log Expansion)

- ✅ **Miles covered tracking** - track walking/hiking/running distance with decimal precision
- ✅ **Elevation gain tracking** - integer-only input for feet climbed
- ✅ **Sokay tracking system** - accountability for unhealthy food choices
- ✅ **Cumulative sokay counting** - running total across all days up to current date
- ✅ **Sokay view screen** - dedicated interface for managing sokay entries
- ✅ **Updated markdown title** - "Mountains Training Log" reflects expanded scope
- ✅ **Database schema migration** - automatic column addition for backward compatibility
- ✅ **Extended measurements display** - all tracking fields visible in daily view

### Previous Sessions

- ✅ Turso Cloud integration with local libsql database
- ✅ Dual persistence (cloud database + markdown backups)
- ✅ Automatic background sync every 4 minutes
- ✅ Daily notes with multi-line text editing
- ✅ Cursor visibility and text navigation in input fields
- ✅ Edit and delete functionality for food entries
- ✅ Proper ratatui padding instead of literal spaces
- ✅ Clean list highlighting without arrow symbols
- ✅ Weight and waist size tracking with dedicated input screens
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts for quick measurement editing
- ✅ Modular code structure (events, ui modules)

## Architecture Notes

- **App struct** - Main application coordinator managing state, database, and UI
- **State management** - AppScreen enum for view routing (19 different screens including Startup and Syncing)
- **Dual persistence** - libsql database (primary) + markdown files (backup)
- **Offline-first design** - Local database initializes instantly, cloud connection deferred to background
- **Cloud sync** - Syncs on startup (background) and shutdown (with visual feedback), graceful offline handling
- **Connection state tracking** - Real-time monitoring of Turso Cloud connection status
- **Async architecture** - Fully async event loop and database operations using tokio
- **Thread-safe database** - Arc<RwLock<DbManager>> for shared access across async tasks
- **Input handling** - Specialized handlers for text, numeric, integer, and multi-line input
- **Elevation statistics** - Dedicated module for calculating monthly/yearly stats and streaks
- **Modular design** - Separated concerns (models, events, ui, database, file management, stats)
- **Responsive UI** - Terminal size adaptation with ratatui layout system, live sync status display
- **Data integrity** - Database transactions for atomic operations
- **Error handling** - anyhow for ergonomic error propagation

### Key Data Structures

- **DailyLog** - Main data model with food_entries, measurements, sokay_entries, strength_mobility, notes
- **AppState** - Application state with daily_logs cache, current screen/selection, and focused_section
- **FocusedSection** - Enum tracking which section has focus (Measurements, Running, FoodItems, Sokay, StrengthMobility, Notes)
- **MeasurementField** - Enum for tracking focus within Measurements section (Weight, Waist)
- **RunningField** - Enum for tracking focus within Running section (Miles, Elevation)
- **SectionNavigator** - Pure function-based navigation logic for section and field traversal
- **InputHandler** - Cursor position tracking and input validation
- **DbManager** - Async database operations with deferred cloud connection and state tracking
- **ConnectionState** - Enum tracking sync status (Disconnected, Connected, Error)
- **FileManager** - Markdown serialization/deserialization for backups

# Rust coding guidelines

- Prioritize code correctness and clarity. Speed and efficiency are secondary priorities unless otherwise specified.
- Do not write comments that summarize the code. Comments should only be written in order to explain "why" the code is written in some way in the case there is a reason that is tricky / non-obvious. But do write comments that document APIs.

# important-instruction-reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

- always update @CLAUDE.md with changes
- clean up dead code as the app evolves and changes are made
